## Linked List
### Write a C program that implements a singly linked list of integers with the following
features:
1. Insert a new node at the end of the list.
2. Insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
3. Delete a node by value. “Don’t forget to free the node”
4. Print size “Count of the nodes”
5. Traverse and display all nodes in the list.
6. Sort the nodes and print it out.
7. Remove duplicates from the sorted nodes.
Expected knowledge: struct, pointers, dynamic memory (malloc/free), linked list traversal.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Write a C program that:
1. Asks the user to enter the number of students.
2. Dynamically allocates memory to store the grades of all students (use malloc).
3. Allows the user to input the grades.
4. Calculates and prints the average grade.
5. Uses realloc to allow the user to add 2 more students and their grades, then recalculates
the average.
6. Finally, frees the allocated memory.
Expected knowledge: malloc, realloc, free, loops, arrays.
