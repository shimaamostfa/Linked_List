### Dynamic Memory Allocation
# Write a C program that:
1. Asks the user to enter the number of students.
2. Dynamically allocates memory to store the grades of all students (use malloc).
3. Allows the user to input the grades.
4. Calculates and prints the average grade.
5. Uses realloc to allow the user to add 2 more students and their grades, then recalculates
the average.
6. Finally, frees the allocated memory.
Expected knowledge: malloc, realloc, free, loops, arrays.
